The language for homework 3
============================

The homework language adds mutation, both explicit (boxes) and 
implicit ( "set" on variables). 

The homework language is based on the language in Chapter 8 of the
text, with the addition of allowing:

In the core syntax:

(i) a list of arguments to "fun" expressions, not just a single
argument.  Empty lists are ok!

And in the sugared syntax, we allow:

(ii)  a list of bindings in "with" expressions

and

(iii) a list of expressions in "seq" expressions.  Empty lists here
  are NOT ok.

Since we have mutation, we have to specify a few things

- In an application, evaluate the function first, then the arguments.
(The arguments are all evaluated in the same environment, but NOT
necessarily in the same store.)

- Evaluate the arguments to a function in left-to-right order.

- The set and setbox operators return the value that has been assigned
  to the variable or box contents (i.e., both (set x 5) and (setbox b
  5) should return (numV 5)).
